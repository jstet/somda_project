Unfortunately, there are no conclusive results from this study as the data retrieval process most likely contains errors. For these reasons, the reproduction of the paper by Yasseri et al. was not successful. 

However, two conclusions can still be drawn from this circumstance. Firstly, if scientific papers truly want to be replicable, they should either include all of the data, or describe the data retrieval process in more detail. A git repository is the ideal way to share code. 

Moreover, The Wikipedia API should be used to retrieve data instead of manually downloading page view dump files, as APIs already include filter options that make it more probable that the data is not erroneous. Also, data quality before the introduction of the page view API is not ensured, as data was compiled by different people in different formats \cite{WikiDumps2023}.
